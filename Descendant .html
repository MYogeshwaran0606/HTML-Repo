        <h2>NINJA 650</h2>
        <p>The Kawasaki KZ650 was the brainchild of Ben Inamura, who envisioned the bike as a middleweight version of their vaunted Z900. The KZ650 ran from 1977 through 1983, underwent numerous iterations and modifications, and proved to be a strong, reliable seller for Kawasaki.</p>
