    <h1>AUDI</h1>
    <p>On July 16, 1909 automotive pioneer August Horch founded August Horch Automobilwerke GmbH in Germany. A short time later he renamed the company after the Latin translation of his last name â€“ making it Audi Automobilwerke. In 1932, Audi merged with Horch, DKW and Wanderer, to form Auto Union AG.</p>
