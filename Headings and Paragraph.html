    <h1>Car</h1>
    <P>It originally referred to any wheeled horse-drawn vehicle, such as a cart, carriage, or wagon. "Motor car", attested from 1895, is the usual formal term in British English. "Autocar", a variant likewise attested from 1895 and literally meaning "self-propelled car", is now considered archaic.</P>

    <p>However, what many people consider the first practical bicycle was created in 1817 by Karl von Drais, a German civil servant. In 1868, the first documented bicycle race was held. Bikers racked 1,200 meters in the Park of Saint-Cloud in Paris. In the U.S., bicycles were incredibly popular in the early 1900s.</p>
